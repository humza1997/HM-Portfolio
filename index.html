<h2>About me</h2>
<p id="about"> Hi there! I'm Humza. I'm 23 years old and have lived in London my whole life. As clich√© as it sounds, i've had a love for creating things, ever since I was small. This interest of creating and wondering how things worked, led me to going down the engineering education route. I followed that all the way through, but somewhere down the line, I lost that creative part of it, which was my main driver.</p>
