      <p>
        Hi there, I’m Humza and I love to create!
        <br />
        <br />
        In 2018, I graduated from Queen Mary University of London, with a BEng in Mechanical Engineering. Shortly after,
        I started a graduate scheme in Building Services Engineering, working for the largest housing association in
        London. Two years into my grad scheme, I made the decision to switch careers to tech and I haven’t looked back
        since!
